# RENTIFY - Car-rental service

(https://carriedbydog.github.io/Car-rental/)

This project was created using [Create React App].

During the project's development, the following libraries were utilized:

1. For styling: Toastify, Tailwind, daisyUI, Swiper, Lucide-react, React-icons,
   React-loader-spinner.
2. For database operations: Axios, Redux Toolkit.
3. The back-end was created using the mockApi service (https://mockapi.io).

## The application consists of three pages:

**Home**: The home page features a swiper for showcasing some available cars. It
includes the site's name and a brief description.

**Catalog**: On the Catalog page, users can choose from 12 cars. Clicking the
"Load more" button loads an additional 12 cars. The page also provides filtering
options based on three categories (Car brand, Price/1 hour, Car mileage/km).
Users can select their desired car brand, price, and car mileage using these
filters. Each car card displays a brief description and a photo. If users want
to learn more about a specific car, clicking the "Learn More" button opens a
modal window with more detailed information about the car. Most importantly, the
modal window features a "Rental car" button, allowing users to contact the
company and book the car. Each car card also includes a heart-shaped button that
allows users to add the car to their favorites.

**Favorites**: The Favorites page automatically displays the cars that users
have selected as favorites. Users can manage this list (remove cars from
favorites). By clicking "Load more," users can view more detailed information
and make a car reservation.

A sidebar menu is available on each page for quick site navigation.
